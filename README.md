SQL Data Cleaning and Exploration Project
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for data cleaning and exploration, focusing on a dataset related to company layoffs. Below are the key SQL concepts and techniques applied in the project:
Data Extraction: SQL allows you to extract data from relational databases efficiently. By writing SQL queries, you can retrieve specific subsets of data that are relevant to your analysis.

Data Manipulation: SQL provides powerful data manipulation capabilities. You can use SQL to perform aggregations, sorting, filtering, joining tables, and transforming data. This flexibility enables you to reshape and prepare the data for further analysis.

Data Aggregation: SQL supports various aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, and MIN. These functions allow you to calculate metrics and summary statistics on your data, providing valuable insights during analysis.

Data Filtering: SQL's WHERE clause allows you to filter data based on specific criteria. This capability is crucial when you need to focus on a subset of data that meets certain conditions, such as analyzing sales from a specific region or examining customer behavior within a particular timeframe.

Data Joins: SQL enables you to combine data from multiple tables using join operations. This is particularly useful when you have data spread across different tables and need to merge them to gain a comprehensive view. Joins facilitate complex analyses involving relationships between different entities.

Data Aggregation: SQL allows you to aggregate data across groups using the GROUP BY clause. This capability enables you to perform analyses at various levels of granularity, such as summarizing sales by region, product category, or time period.

Data Transformation: SQL provides functions for data transformation, allowing you to clean and standardize data. You can perform tasks like data type conversions, string manipulations, and date/time calculations, making your data suitable for analysis.

Performance and Scalability: SQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently. They optimize query execution and provide indexing options, ensuring faster retrieval and analysis of data. This scalability is essential for handling big data analysis.
